#The TwoWire library for Arduino

This library started out as a copy of the standard Wire library as
delivered with Arduino 1.5.8

The reason to create this copy were mainly because of the following:
* we needed some modifications
* the Arduino source is not maintained separately (as a normal library)
* we want to be able to work with version control (GIT)
